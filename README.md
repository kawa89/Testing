# SDA Android Testing

While writing the tasks, I was inspired by:

* [robolectric/robolectric-samples](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric-samples)
* [SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator)

Note: The apps/code is not super written, this repo is just write/learn basic Android app testing.
